  <h3>Project Purpose</h3>
  <p>This is intended as a template for desktop like progressive web apps. But currently is is more of an evaluation, if and how hugo can be used for this purpose.</p>

  <h2 class="fiverrToDo">ToDo:</h2>
  <h3>Page resources:</h3>
  <p>this is the main struggling point. Each page should be able to add js, css, ... as needed. Some pages will require in addition external libraries (from CDN) like:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Firebase</li>
    <li>Threejs</li>
  </ul>
  <p>importatnt with js scripts is, that some need to be of type="module" and some might need to be defered </p>
